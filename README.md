# Striker (Chrome Extension)

This is a small chrome plugin that allows people to remove DOM elements by
hovering over them with the mouse and holding down the shift key. The element
will be highlighted and fade out for a second. If at any time you release the
shift key, the element will not be deleted.

## Usability

Turns out the shift key is a little to simple. **TODO**: come up with a better
mechanism. Perhaps double tap shift then hold.
